 * Text that carried no label is placed by position and reported as an
 * `unlabelled-text` warning — so the worst case is a value in the wrong field,
 * in plain sight, rather than a value that disappeared. No warnings at all
 * means the text was already in this package's own format.
 *
 * No tables and no guessing; for text from somewhere else use
 * {@linkcode importAddress}.
 *
 * ```ts
 * parseAddress("เลขที่ 99/1 แขวงคลองตัน เขตวัฒนา จังหวัดกรุงเทพมหานคร 10110").address;
 * // { kind: "thai", addressNo: "99/1", subdistrict: "คลองตัน", … }
